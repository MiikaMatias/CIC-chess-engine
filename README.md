# magochess
Chess engine to beat my friend with. The idea is to use a rudimentary bitboard representation to speed up calculation times. Some sort of heuristic-based Alpha-beta thingy will be implemented idklol.

# How to run
Run chessboard via 'rustc main.rs; ./main' or just run the bat script in ´chess_game/src´
